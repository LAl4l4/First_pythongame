# First_pythongame
This is my first python game. As I want to find a way to create a window-based game, where the python is the best choice, I download pygame and create this project. Furthermore, AI help me a lot in this project, which prompt and motivates me to learn the python well.

To run this project, you need Python 3.13.3 as well as pygame.
